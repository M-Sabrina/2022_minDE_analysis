"""
Spatial autocorrelation analysis is performed on a set number of images per movie.
For each autocorrelation output image, a radial profile is recorded starting from
the main central correlation peak. The resulting spatial radial correlation curves 
are subjected to maxima analysis. The first maximum after radius R=0 indicates the
most predominant distance between wave edges, irrespective of propagation direction.
This distance is identified as the pattern's global wavelength.

Input: directory with pre-cleaned movies as tif files (3D).
Output: png files for radial autocorrelation curves, csv file for characteristic
parameters.

Characteristic parameters are:
    "valley_pos" - position of first minimum in um
    "valley_val" - amplitude of first minimum
    "peak_pos" - position of first maximum in um --> wavelength
    "peak_val" - amplitude of first maximum
